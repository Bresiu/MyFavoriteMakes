# MyFavoriteMakes

My favorite makes
As a user, I want to see a list of vehicle makes so that I can choose which ones are my favorites.

### Acceptance criteria:
- App opens on a main screen
- The main screen contains a number that represents the selected favorite count.
- The main screen contains a button that when pressed opens a secondary screen to select
favorite vehicle makes
- The secondary screen displays a list of makes such as Audi, BMW, Tesla, etc.
- Each item from the list has an action button that will toggle the favorite status of the selected make.
- Returning to the main screen, displays the updated favorite count.

## Implementation hints:
- List of makes can be hardcoded for now, but in the future it will be loaded from an API. Design your
solution with this in mind.
- Favorite statuses donâ€™t have to be persisted but they have to be kept for as long as the app is
running. In the future they will have to be persisted.

## We want to see:
- How you design the interface
- How you implement business logic
- How you test your implementation
